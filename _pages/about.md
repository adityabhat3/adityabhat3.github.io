I'm a software engineer who enjoys building things that are interesting, useful, and well-crafted.

Outside of work, I’m either lifting, reading something CS-related, or catching a flight somewhere new. I like minimal design, deep dives into tech, and conversations that lead to good ideas.

I’m always open to interesting projects—whether it's building, collaborating, or just bouncing ideas. Feel free to reach out.
