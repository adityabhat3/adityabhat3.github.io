Hey, I’m Aditya 👋 I’m a software engineer at Rippling, where I work on making our product more global. I studied Computer Science at BITS Pilani Goa, and along the way I’ve dabbled in everything from measuring internet latency to training diffusion models for medical imaging to running ML on tiny devices.

I love building things, exploring startups, traveling, and tackling tough tech problems. If you’ve got an interesting project—or just want to chat—feel free to reach out!
