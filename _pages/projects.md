Here are some projects I’ve worked on recently — focused on learning through building interesting stuff.

#### 🌐 Const-Lat  
I studied the constancy of internet latency at the edge, releasing our [code and data](https://github.com/adityabhat3/const-lat) alongside the [paper](https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/on-the-constancy-of-latency-at-the-internets-edge).  
The work was presented at **TMA 2025**, showing that last-mile latency is far more stable than expected. I wrote a [blog post](https://pulse.internetsociety.org/blog/on-the-constancy-of-latency-at-the-internets-edge) about it too.

#### 📝 This Website!  
I built this site using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) Jekyll theme and customized it to showcase my projects and writing.  
I also added [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) to understand my audience better. The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/adityabhat3/adityabhat3.github.io), feel free to reuse it.

More projects coming soon — work in progress!
